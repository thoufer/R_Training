# R Studio Layout and Configuation

## RStudio Navigation and Configuration

 R comes built in with its own editor.  It's basically notepad with a toolbar across the top. \textbf{It sucks!!}
		
 Your R experience will be much better using RStudio in which the editor has a ton more features that will allow you to work more efficiently.
		
Some of those features which we will be exploring are:
	
1. Color syntax
1. Tab auto-completion
1. Line wrapping
1. Keyboard shortcut keys

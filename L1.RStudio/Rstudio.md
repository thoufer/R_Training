# R Studio Layout and Configuation

## RStudio Navigation and Configuration
R comes built in with its own editor.  It's basically notepad with a toolbar across the top. **It sucks!! Don't bother with it.**
		
Your R experience will be much better using RStudio in which the editor has a ton more features that will allow you to work more efficiently.  RSudio is what is referred to as an IDE, or Integrated Development Enviroment. It's designed to provide just about all of the funcional elements of R (i.e., code, plots, output,help, and dubugging) without ever leaving the program.
		
Since, RStudio is an interface with a lot of functionality, I wouldn't be doing justice to its power as a piece of software.  The best way to get an understanding of RStudio [and R for that matter] is to watch a video.  

The Makers of RStidio have put together a full webinar series, which you may find valuable (Note: I have not watched the entire series).  However, I suggest that you watch the first video just to get an understanding of the IDE and how to navigate around.  In order to view the video, you will need to enter you name and an email address, and the video will begin to play.. Presumably, this won't result in unwanted spam.  

At the moment, its not important to understand the commands that are being run, but to understand the features and cababilities of the program.  I will say that the narrator is running R on a mac, and some of the keyboard commands differ between Windoze and mac..
